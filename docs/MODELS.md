# Transition-model contracts

The [atomic ledger](../atomic-claims.json) links each obligation below to exact
source ranges, checked theorems, shared assumptions and remaining implementation
work. All counts are unbounded mathematical naturals. All traces are arbitrary
finite lists, not enumerated test cases. Supporting definitions and proofs are
checked together by the pinned mechanism-lang compiler.

## Pending connection ownership

[21-pending-lifecycle.mech](../proofs/21-pending-lifecycle.mech) models a fixed pool
whose cells are free or held at a particular generation. Reservation succeeds
only in a free cell. Completion releases a held cell only when its owned token
matches that cell's generation. Release advances the generation before reuse.

The proofs cover failure, establishment, established-hook refusal, timeout and
cancellation. A callback without ownership cannot refund a slot. Repeating a
terminal callback is idempotent, and an old callback cannot release a slot after
release and reuse, including arbitrarily later generations. Over every finite
reserve/complete trace, occupancy is bounded by the initial pool capacity and
occupied plus available cells equals that capacity.

The implementation obligations include the `ConnectionId` mapping, atomic
reserve/complete operations, callback-token provenance, every real terminal path,
and counter wrap behavior. The model does not permit an attacker to forge an
internal completion token.

## Handshake rate and resource cost

[25-handshake-budget.mech](../proofs/25-handshake-budget.mech) gives both swarms one
shared balance. Every accepted validated handshake consumes a credit. Refill is
clamped to capacity. Identity changes, source eviction and admission-policy
changes do not replenish it; a claimed clock event cannot issue credits.

For arbitrary event traces, accepted starts are at most the initial balance plus
all trusted credits issued. Given an initially bounded balance, it remains
bounded by bucket capacity. [26-discrete-rate-envelope.mech](../proofs/26-discrete-rate-envelope.mech)
adds a fixed number of credits per trusted tick and proves:

```text
accepted handshake starts <= burst + trusted ticks * credits per tick
```

This proof counts traffic from both swarms and every represented identity,
including trusted identities. It has no trust exemption from the shared budget.
An actual per-second envelope requires a bound relating trusted ticks to elapsed
time, including clock jumps, suspend/resume and refill rounding. Restart handling,
per-source penalties and honest reconnect fairness require further models.

[22-weighted-resources.mech](../proofs/22-weighted-resources.mech) composes queue,
pending and established counts using separate cost weights, including both swarm
pools and arbitrary pending traces. The rate model similarly lifts the start
bound to a weighted handshake-cost bound. Actual memory or CPU bounds require
evidence that the selected weights dominate costs and that no resource category
is omitted. A concurrency bound does not by itself establish a rate bound.

## Poll continuation and critical service

[15-poll-continuation.mech](../proofs/15-poll-continuation.mech) proves that bounded
poll work plus retained backlog equals the original backlog. Exhausted fuel
retains the rest, and any remaining event requests a wakeup, including Retry-only
backlogs and every transport outcome. The implementation must register and use a
real waker correctly. The model cannot force an executor to schedule it.

[35-critical-service.mech](../proofs/35-critical-service.mech) tracks the number of
critical requests ahead of a target. Each completed service round removes one
predecessor or serves the target. Later arrivals do not increase its rank. If
the trace contains at least `initial rank + 1` completed rounds, the target has
been served. Once served, it stays served.

This is a conditional progress theorem. It requires a queue implementation with
the stated FIFO projection and a scheduler that performs the critical step each
round. It does not prove enough rounds occur before a wall-clock deadline, nor
does it establish consensus liveness under arbitrary network failure.

## Committee recovery

[31-committee-records.mech](../proofs/31-committee-records.mech) represents each
current committee member by one fixed slot. A record can mark its slot only when
it is authenticated and matches the current epoch. Old-epoch and unverified
records leave resolution unchanged. Repeated records are idempotent, preserve
roster size, and cannot advance the closure decision. Resolved members cannot
outnumber the fixed roster.

An epoch reset clears every resolution bit while preserving roster size. With a
positive required threshold, the new epoch cannot close using those cleared
records. These proofs assume authenticated binding of identity and epoch, and a
unique stable slot for each member. Signature verification, timestamp freshness,
membership changes, the committee-minus-f threshold and atomic snapshot ordering
remain implementation or additional modeling obligations.

## Negative controls

The checker rejects 32 invalid variants: three direct checks of equality,
ordering and termination, plus 29 semantic mutations. Mutations exercise such
faults as stale-owner release, skipped terminal cleanup, growing pool capacity,
uncapped refill, forged or duplicated credits, lost poll backlog, missing
wakeups, skipped service, unauthenticated committee records and stale epoch
resolution. Failure must be a semantic checker diagnostic; syntax errors and
crashes do not count as a successful negative control.

Passing these controls tests that the definitions constrain the proof terms.
It does not prove the checker sound, the Rust implementation refined, or the
deployment qualified. `make qualify` therefore continues to reject completion.

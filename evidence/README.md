# Evidence still required

No runtime or deployment result has been supplied or synthesized. The `.build`
report records local model checking only. The current complete-qualification
command rejects all implementation and deployment certification.

`initial-model-check.json` preserves the first model-checking receipt.
`trace-model-check.json` records the expanded transition proofs, atomic ledger,
semantic mutation checks and validation of the pinned implementation file hashes.
`portable-bootstrap-model-check.json` repeats that validation after fixing fresh
GitHub bootstrapping to fetch only the compiler's required Veil submodule.
`policy-model-check.json` records versioned policy and receipt proofs, mixed
resource traces, their negative controls and the pinned implementation source links.
`source-table-model-check.json` records bounded source-table churn, preservation
of existing security state, four additional atomic obligations and 15 additional
semantic mutation checks. It was produced without `--implementation`, so its
`implementation_links` status is `not_checked_this_run`: that run did not compare
the pinned implementation file hashes.
The earlier receipts carry `source_links_checked`, most recently
`policy-model-check.json` (revision 579aa551fe39593e32a48e1dbcfeccbccab64e3e,
6 entries). To restore the check, run `python3 -I tools/check.py --implementation
/path/to/telcoin-network` against a checkout at that revision and copy
`.build/report.json` over the receipt being refreshed.
`source-enforcement-model-check.json` records bounded per-source charging,
simultaneous restrictions, independent trusted expiry, four new atomic
obligations and 27 new semantic mutation checks. It also has
`implementation_links: not_checked_this_run`. That receipt covers 264 proof
declarations, 44 atomic obligations and 90 rejected negative checks. Those two
source receipts do not establish keyed-table/global-resource composition.
`source-system-model-check.json` records keyed lookup and mixed source-table
churn, charging, bans and expiry, with four new atomic obligations and 18 new
semantic mutation checks. It covers 293 equality and order proof declarations,
48 atomic obligations and 108 rejected negative checks. Its
`implementation_links` status is also `not_checked_this_run`. That receipt
covers source-system composition alone.
`source-admission-model-check.json` records atomic admission across source quota,
shared credits and pending ownership, indexed internal receipts, mixed trace
bounds, four new atomic obligations and 32 new semantic mutation checks. It
covers 344 equality and order proof declarations, 52 atomic obligations and
140 rejected negative checks. Its `implementation_links` status remains
`not_checked_this_run`. That receipt covers state bounds and indexed lifecycle
behavior, before adding a coupled cumulative rate bound.
`source-admission-rate-model-check.json` records receipt-counted accepted starts,
shared-credit conservation, a discrete burst-plus-rate envelope and its per-start
cost bound. It includes four new atomic obligations and 25 new semantic mutation
checks, covering 366 equality and order proof declarations, 56 atomic obligations
and 165 rejected negative checks. Its `implementation_links` status remains
`not_checked_this_run`. Real clock correspondence, dominance of the supplied
per-start cost weight over real accepted-start work, rejected-attempt cost, live
per-source pending attribution, policy and established-resource integration,
configuration changes, timer validation, restart persistence and deployment
qualification remain open.
These are reproducible local receipts within the trust boundary described in
[TRUST.md](../docs/TRUST.md), not deployment measurements or external attestations.

The authoritative run requirements are in
[the acceptance specification](../sources/w1-modified/04-DECISIONS-AND-ACCEPTANCE.md).
Each future run needs exact implementation/dependency/configuration identities,
accepted thresholds, hardware and host settings, topology, offered and accepted
load, traffic generation details, raw metrics, instrumentation overhead, test
duration, failures and uncertainty. Include the firewall state and all swarms.

Gate 1 covers the maintained Retry feature. Gates 2 through 6 additionally cover
resource/timeout settings, resilience, topology/transaction paths, operations
and storage. A feature-level result does not satisfy the remaining gates.

Operational evidence remains an explicit environmental assumption even when a
formal model proves that its recorded values satisfy an acceptance predicate.
